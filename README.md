# Budgie-Super-Key-Launcher
<p>(Super) Dirty, four lines workaround for using Budgie Desktop with Super + 1, Super + 2 ... Window key binding: </p>

<br>

![](example.gif)
<p>0-) Install wmctrl </p><br>
<p>1-) Download SuperKey.sh  and check if it's set as an executable.</p><br>
<p>2-) Inside it, replace all replace "Your_program" with your program name (starting with Capital letter), keeping it inside simple quotes ' '. Replace all "your_program" with lower case program name.  </p><br>
<p>3-) Set the keyboard shortcut for the position you want. Eg: Firefox is the first program on my window list. So I'm going to set the key binding Super+1 to the path to SuperKey.sh</p><br>
<p>4-) Repeat the process for your pinned applications (it will not work for unpinned applications, as this script is very simple and doesn't really know the position of the icons in the taskbar). But it would be a nice addition. </p><br>
